This is the source for my personal website. The pages are built with [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) and hosted on GitHub Pages.

## Structure
- `_layouts/` contains the base HTML layout
- `_includes/` holds reusable header and footer snippets
- `assets/js/main.js` updates the copyright year dynamically
- Individual pages use front matter and the `default` layout

To preview locally, install Jekyll and run `jekyll serve` from the project root.
