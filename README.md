This repository contains the source for my personal website. The site is a simple collection of static HTML pages hosted with GitHub Pages.

## Pages
- **index.html** - Landing page with navigation
- **about.html** - A short bio
- **resume.html** - Placeholder for resume information
- **projects.html** - Page listing personal projects

Feel free to edit these pages directly or update the accompanying `styles.css` file to change the look and feel of the site.
